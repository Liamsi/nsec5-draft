        <t>
            The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the NSEC resource
            record (RR) for authenticated denial of existence and the NSEC3 for hashed
            authenticated denial of existence.

            The NSEC RR allows for the entire zone contents to be enumerated if a server is
            queried for carefully chosen domain names; N queries suffice to enumerate a zone
            containing N names. The NSEC3 RR adds domain-name hashing, which makes the zone
            enumeration harder, but not impossible.

            This document introduces NSEC5, which provides an cryptographically-proven mechanism
            that prevents zone enumeration. NSEC5 has the additional advantage of not requiring
            private zone-signing keys to be present on all authoritative servers for the zone.

        <section title="Rationale">

            <!--
                You can echo the abstract in the Introduction, providing citations here, but you
                should provide more than just the abstract.

            <t>
                The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides data integrity protection using
                public-key cryptography, while not requiring that authoritative servers compute signatures
                on-the-fly. The content of the zone is usually pre-computed and served as is.
                The evident advantages of this approach are reduced performance requirements
                per query, as well as not requiring private zone-signing keys to be present
                on nameservers facing the network.
            </t>

            <t>
                With DNSSEC, each resource record (RR) set in the zone is signed. The signature
                is retained as an RRSIG RR directly in the zone. This enables response
                authentication for data existing in the zone. To ensure integrity of denying
                answers, an NSEC chain of all existing domain names in the zone is constructed.
                The chain is made of RRs, where each RR represents two consecutive domain names in
                canonical order present in the zone. The NSEC RRs are signed the same way as
                any other RRs in the zone, and each NSEC can be used to prove that a given
                name does not existing in a part of the domain name space.
            </t>

            <t>
                As side-effect, however, the NSEC chain allows for enumeration of the zone's
                contents by sequentially querying for the names immediately following those
                in the most-recently retrieved NSEC record; N queries suffice to enumerate
                a zone containing N names. As such, the
                NSEC3 hashed denial of existence was introduced to prevent zone enumeration.
                In NSEC3, the original domain names in the NSEC chain are replaced by their
                cryptographic hashes.  While NSEC3 makes zone enumeration more difficult, offline
                dictionary attacks are still possible and have been demonstrated; this is
                because hashes may be computed offline and the space of possible domain names
                is restricted <xref target="nsec3walker" /><xref target="nsec3gpu" />.
            </t>

            <t>
                Zone enumeration can be prevented with NSEC3 if having the authoritative server
                compute NSEC3 RRs on-the-fly, in response to queries with denying responses. Usually,
                this is done with Minimally Covering NSEC Records or NSEC3 White Lies
                <xref target="RFC7129" />. One of the most significant disadvantage of this
                approach is a required presence of the private key on all authoritative servers
                for the zone. This is often undesirable, as the holder of the private key can
                tamper with the zone content, and having private keys on many network-facing servers
                increases the risk that keys can be compromised.
            </t>

            <t>
                To prevent zone content enumeration without keeping private keys on all
                authoritative servers, NSEC5 replaces the unkeyed cryptographic hash function used
                in NSEC3 with a public-key hashing scheme. Hashing in NSEC5 is performed with
                a separate NSEC5 key. The public portion of this key is distributed in an
                NSEC5KEY RR, and is used to validate NSEC5 hash values.  The private portion
                of the NSEC5 key is present on all authoritative servers for the zone, and is
                used to compute hash values.
            </t>

            <t>
                Importantly, the NSEC5KEY key cannot be used to
                modify the contents of the zone. Thus, any compromise of the private NSEC5 key
                does not lead to a compromise of zone contents; all that is lost is privacy against
                zone enumeration, effectively downgrading the security of NSEC5 to that of NSEC3.
                NSEC5 comes with a cryptographic proof of security, available in
                <xref target="nsec5" />.
            </t>

            <t>
                The NSEC5 is not intended to replace NSEC or NSEC3. It is designed as an
                alternative mechanism for authenticated denial of existence.

    <section title="How NSEC5 Works">
        <t>
            To prove non-existence of a domain name in a zone, NSEC uses a chain built from
            domain names present in the zone. NSEC3 replaces the original domain names by
            their cryptographic hashes. NSEC5 is very similar to NSEC3, however a public-key
            based hashing scheme is used.
        </t>

        <t>
            In NSEC5, the original domain name is hashed twice:
        </t>

        <t>
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    First, the domain name is hashed using the NSEC5 private key; the result
                    is called the NSEC5 proof.  Only an authoritative server that knows the
                    private NSEC5 key can compute the NSEC5 proof.  Any client that knows
                    the public NSEC5 key can validate the NSEC5 proof.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Second, the NSEC5 proof is hashed using a cryptographic hash function; the
                    result is called the NSEC5 hash.  This hash can be computed by any party
                    that knows the input NSEC5 proof.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>

        <t>
            The NSEC5 hash determines the position of a domain name in an NSEC5 chain.
            That is, all the NSEC5 hashes for a zone are sorted in their canonical order,
            and each consecutive pair forms an NSEC5 RR.
        </t>

        <t>
            To prove an non-existence of a particular domain name in response to a query, the
            server computes on the fly, the NSEC5 proof (using the private NSEC5 key). Then it
            uses the NSEC5 proof to compute the corresponding NSEC5 hash. It then identifies
            the NSEC5 RR that covers the hash. In the response message, the server returns the
            NSEC5 RR, it's corresponding signature (RRSIG RRset), and synthesized NSEC5PROOF RR
            containing the NSEC5 proof it computed on the fly.
        </t>

        <t>
            To validate the response, the client first uses the public NSEC5 key (stored in the
            zone as an NSEC5KEY RR) to verify that the NSEC5 proof corresponds with the domain
            name to be disproved. Then, the client computes the NSEC5 hash from the NSEC5 proof
            and checks if the NSEC5 RR content and it's signature are valid.

            The algorithms used for NSEC5 authenticated denial are independent of the algorithms
            used for DNSSEC signing. An NSEC5 algorithm defines how the NSEC5 proof and the
            NSEC5 hash is computed and validated.

        <t>
            The input for the NSEC5 proof computation is an RR owner name in the canonical form

                The Wildcard flag indicates that a wildcard synthesis is possible at the

                descending from the immediate ancestor of the original domain name). The
                purpose of the Wildcard flag is to reduce a maximum number of RRs required for
                authenticated denial of existence proof.

                This specification modifies DNSSEC-enabled DNS responses generated by
                authoritative servers. In particular, it replaces use of NSEC or NSEC3 RRs in
                such responses with NSEC5 RRs and adds on-the-fly computed NSEC5PROOF RRs.
            </t>

            <t>
                The authenticated denial of existence proofs in NSEC5 are almost the same
                as in NSEC3. However, due to introduction of Wildcard flag in NSEC5 RRs, the
                NSEC5 proof consists from (up to) two NSEC5 RRs, instead of (up to) three.
            </t>

            <t>
                According to a type of a response, an authoritative server MUST include NSEC5 RRs
                in a response as defined in <xref target="nsec5_proofs" />. For each NSEC5 RR
                in the response a matching RRSIG RRset and a synthesized NSEC5PROOF MUST be added
                as well.
            </t>

            <t>
                A synthesized NSEC5PROOF RR has the owner name set to a domain name exactly
                matching the name required for the proof. The class and TTL of the RR MUST
                be the same as the class and TTL value of the corresponding NSEC5 RR. The RDATA
                are set according to the description in <xref target="nsec5proof_rdata" />.
            </t>

            <t>
                Notice, that the NSEC5PROOF owner name can be a wildcard (e.g., source of
                synthesis proof in wildcard No Data responses). The name also always matches
                the domain name required for the proof while the NSEC5 RR may only cover
                (not match) the name in the proof (e.g., closest encloser in Name Error responses).
            </t>

            <t>
                If NSEC5 is used, an answering server MUST use exactly one NSEC5 chain for
                one signed zone.
            </t>

            <t>
                NSEC5 MUST NOT be used in parallel with NSEC, NSEC3, or any other authenticated
                denial of  existence mechanism that allows for enumeration of zone contents.
            </t>

            <t>
                Similarly to NSEC3, the owner names of NSEC5 RRs are not represented in the
                NSEC5 chain and therefore NSEC5 records deny their own existence. The desired
                behavior caused by this paradox is the same as described in Section 7.2.8
                of <xref target="RFC5155" />.

                Replacement of the NSEC5 key implies generating a new NSEC5 chain. The NSEC5KEY
                rollover mechanism is similar to "Pre-Publish Zone Signing Key Rollover" as
                specified in <xref target="RFC6781" />. The NSEC5KEY rollover MUST be
                performed as a sequence of the following steps:

                    <t>
                        The old NSEC5 chain is replaced by a new NSEC5 chain constructed
                        using the new key. This replacement MUST happen as a single atomic
                        operation; the server MUST NOT be responding with RRs from
                        both the new and old chain at the same time.

                NSEC5KEY RRset.

            <t>
                The minimal delay between the steps 2. and 3. MUST be the time it takes for the

                Zones that are signed with unknown NSEC5 algorithm or by an unavailable NSEC5

        <section title="Dynamic Updates">
            <t>
                A zone signed using NSEC5 MAY accept dynamic updates. The changes to the zone
                MUST be performed in a way, that the zone satisfies the properties specified
                in <xref target="zone_signing" /> at any time.

            <t>
                It is RECOMMENDED that the server rejects all updates containing changes to
                the NSEC5 chain (or related RRSIG RRs) and performs itself any required
                alternations of the NSEC5 chain induced by the update.
            </t>

            <t>
                Alternatively, the server MUST verify that all the properties are satisfied

            The same considerations as described in Section 9 of <xref target="RFC5155" />
            for NSEC3 apply to NSEC5. In addition, as NSEC5 RRs can be validated only with
            appropriate NSEC5PROOF RRs, the NSEC5PROOF RRs MUST be all together cached and
            included in responses with NSEC5 RRs.

    <section title="Validator Considerations">
        <section title="Validating Responses">
            <t>
                The validator MUST ignore NSEC5 RRs with Flags field values other than the ones
                defined in <xref target="nsec5_flags" />.
            </t>

            <t>
                The validator MAY treat responses as bogus if the response contains NSEC5 RRs
                that refer to a different NSEC5KEY.
            </t>

            <t>
                According to a type of a response, the validator MUST verify all conditions defined
                in <xref target="nsec5_proofs" />. Prior to making decision based on the content
                of NSEC5 RRs in a response, the NSEC5 RRs MUST be validated.
            </t>

            <t>
                To validate a denial of existence, zone NSEC5 public keys are required in addition
                to DNSSEC public keys. Similarly to DNSKEY RRs, the NSEC5KEY RRs are present in
                the zone apex.
            </t>

            <t>
                The NSEC5 RR is validated as follows:

                    <t>
                        Select a correct NSEC5 public key to validate the NSEC5PROOF. The Key Tag
                        value of the NSEC5PROOF RR must match with the key tag value computed
                        from the NSEC5KEY RDATA.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Validate the NSEC5 proof present in the NSEC5PROOF Owner Name Hash field
                        using the NSEC5 public key. If there are multiple NSEC5KEY RRs matching
                        the key tag, at least one of the keys must validate the NSEC5 proof.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Compute the NSEC5 hash value from the NSEC5 proof and check if the
                        response contains NSEC5 RR matching or covering the computed NSEC5 hash.
                        The TTL values of the NSEC5 and NSEC5PROOF RRs must be the same.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Validate the signature of the NSEC5 RR.

            </t>

            <t>
                If the NSEC5 RR fails to validate, it MUST be ignored. If some of the conditions
                required for an NSEC5 proof is not satisfied, the response MUST be treated as
                bogus.
            </t>

            <t>
                Notice that determining closest encloser and next closer name in NSEC5 is easier
                than in NSEC3. NSEC5 and NSEC5PROOF RRs are always present in pairs in responses
                and the original owner name of the NSEC5 RR matches the owner name of the
                NSEC5PROOF RR.

                is used to construct NSEC5 hash values. SHA-256 produces a hash of 256 bits,
                which can be encoded in 52 characters in Base32hex without padding. The encoded
                string is prepended to the name of the zone as a single label, which includes
                the length field of a single octet. The maximal length of the zone name is
                therefore 202 octets (255 - 53).

                        NSEC3 uses multiple iterations of the SHA-1 function with an arbitrary salt.
                        The input of the first iteration is the domain name in wire format together
                        with binary salt; the input of the subsequent iterations is the binary
                        digest and the salt. We can assume that the input size will be smaller
                        than 32 octets for most executions.

                        <vspace /><vspace />

                        The measured implementation gives a stable performance for small input
                        blocks up to 32 octets. About 3e6 hashes per second can be computed given
                        these parameters.

                        The number of additional iterations in NSEC3 parameters will probably
                        vary between 0 and 20 in reality. Therefore we can expect the NSEC3 hash
                        computation performance to be between 2e5 and 3e6 hashes per second.

                        The NSEC5 hash is computed in two steps: NSEC5 proof computation followed
                        by hashing of the result. The NSEC5 proof is basically an RSA signature and
                        the performance will therefore vary for signing and verification and also
                        for different key sizes. We can expect that the final hashing will have
                        insignificant impact on the overall hashing performance.

                        <vspace /><vspace />

                        The measurement of NSEC5 proof computation and verification resulted into
                        the following numbers:
                        3e3 sign/s and 4e4 verify/s for 1024-bit key;
                        4e2 sign/s and 1e4 verify/s for 2048-bit key; and
                        5e1 sign/s and 3e3 verify/s for 4096-bit key.

                        <vspace /><vspace />

                        The final SHA-256 hashing is about two orders of magnitude faster given
                        the input block size matching the NSEC5 proof result size.

                        <vspace /><vspace />

                        Picking a moderate key size of 2048-bits, the NSEC5 hash computation
                        performance will be in the order of 10^2 issued hashes per second and
                        10^4 validated hashes per second.

                According to the results, the NSEC5 hashing is about three orders of magnitude
                slower than NSEC3 hashing and the NSEC5 hash verification is about one order
                of magnitude slower than NSEC3 hash verification.

            <t>
                As anticipated, NSEC is the most efficient authenticated denial mechanism as
                for response size and performance cost. The bottleneck of NSEC5 is the NSEC5 proof
                computation. If the proofs are precomputed for domain names in the zone, the server
                has to compute just one NSEC5 proof per answer. But it will still be more expensive
                than NSEC3 and the same applies for the response size.
            </t>

            <t>
                As for the response processing, the validation cost reflects from the records
                present in the response. Again, the NSEC validation seems to be the most
                inexpensive. However the difference between RSA and ECDSA verification performance
                is huge and for some parameters, NSEC3 is faster to validate than NSEC5 and vice
                versa.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <section title="Zone Enumeration Attacks" anchor="zea">
        <t>
         NSEC5 is robust to zone enumeration via offline dictionary attacks by any
         attacker that does not know the NSEC5 private key.  Without the private NSEC5 key,
         that attacker cannot compute the NSEC5 proof that corresponds to a given name;
         the only way it can learn the NSEC5 proof value for a given name is by sending
         a queries for that name to the authoritative server. Without the NSEC5 proof value,
         the attacker cannot learn the NSEC5 hash value. Thus, even an attacker that
         collects the entire chain of NSEC5 RR for a zone cannot use offline attacks to
         "reverse" that NSEC5 hash values in these NSEC5 RR and thus learn which names are
         present in the zone.  A formal cryptographic proof of this property is in
         <xref target="nsec5" />.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Hash Collisions" anchor="hashcol">
        <t>
         Hash collisions between QNAME and the owner name of an NSEC5 RR may
        occur.  When they do, it will be impossible to prove the non-
        existence of the colliding QNAME.  However, with SHA-256, this is
        highly unlikely (on the order of 1 in 2^128).  Note that DNSSEC
        already relies on the presumption that a cryptographic hash function
        is collision resistant, since these hash functions are used
        for generating and validating signatures and DS RRs. See also the
        discussion on key lengths in <xref target="nsec5" />.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Compromise of the Private NSEC5 Key" anchor="keyleak">
        <t>
        NSEC5 requires authoritative servers to hold the private NSEC5 key, but
        not the private zone-signing keys or the private key-signing keys for the zone.
        The private NSEC5 key needs only be as secure as the DNSSEC records
        whose the privacy (against zone-enumeration attacks) that NSEC5 is protecting.
        This is because even an adversary that knows the private NSEC5 key cannot modify
        the contents of the zone; this is because the zone contents are signed using the
        private zone-signing key, while the private NSEC5 key is only used to compute
        NSEC5 proof values.  Thus, a compromise of the private NSEC5 keys does not lead to
        a compromise of the integrity of the DNSSEC record in the zone; instead,
        all that is lost is privacy against zone enumeration, if the attacker that knows
        the private NSEC5 key can compute NSEC5 hashes offline, and thus launch offline
        dictionary attacks.  Thus, a compromise of the private NSEC5 key effectively
        downgrades the security of NSEC5 to that of NSEC3.  A formal cryptographic proof
        of this property is in  <xref target="nsec5" />.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Key Length Considerations" anchor="keylen">
        <t>
        The NSEC5 key must be long enough to withstand attacks
        for as long as the privacy of the zone is important. Even if the NSEC5 key
        is rolled frequently, its length cannot be too short, because zone privacy
        may be important for a period of time longer than the lifetime of the key.
        (For example, an attacker might collect the entire chain of NSEC5 RR for the
        zone over one short period, and then, later (even after the NSEC5 key expires)
        perform an offline dictionary attack that  attempt to "reverse" the NSEC5
        hash values present in the NSEC5 RRs.)
        This is in contrast to zone-signing and key-signing keys used in DNSSEC; these
        keys, which ensure the authenticity and integrity of the zone contents
        need to remain secure only during their lifetime.

         <section title="Transitioning to a New NSEC5 Algorithm" anchor="transAlgo">
         <t>
            Although the NSEC5KEY RR formats include a hash algorithm
            parameter, this document does not define a particular mechanism for
            safely transitioning from one NSEC5 algorithm to another.  When
            specifying a new hash algorithm for use with NSEC5, a transition
            mechanism MUST also be defined.  It is possible that the only
            practical and palatable transition mechanisms may require an
            intermediate transition to an insecure state, or to a state that uses
            NSEC or NSEC3 records instead of NSEC5.

                    Consider alternative way to signalize NSEC5 support. The NSEC5 could use
                    only one DNSSEC algorithm identifier, and the actual algorithm to be used
                    for signing can be the first octet in DNSKEY public key field and RRSIG
                    signature field. Similar approach is used by PRIVATEDNS and PRIVATEOID
                    defined in <xref target="RFC4034" />.

                    How to add new NSEC5 hashing algorithm. We will need to add new DNSSEC
                    algorithm identifiers again.

                <t>
                    NSEC and NSEC3 define optional steps for hash collisions detection. We don't
                    have a way to avoid them if they really appear (unlikely). We would have
                    to drop the signing key and generate a new one. Which cannot be done
                    instantly.
